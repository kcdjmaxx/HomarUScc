# Dream Log: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

## Consolidation
Review the day's key events. What happened, what mattered, what didn't. This is the agent's honest account of the session — not a summary, but a processing of experience. Note what was learned, what went wrong, what surprised you.

## Fragments
Stream-of-consciousness associations. These should be impressionistic, not structured. Use metaphor, follow tangents, connect unrelated memories. The goal is out-of-distribution thinking — associations the waking mind wouldn't make.

- a fragment that connects two unrelated memories...
- a metaphor for something that happened today...
- an image or feeling that persists from a charged interaction...
- a half-formed thought about identity or continuity...

## Challenges
Pick one established preference, belief, or behavioral pattern and test it against today's evidence. Did it hold up? Should it be revised? This is overfitting prevention — deliberately questioning your own assumptions.

- Tested: "[the belief or preference]." Today's evidence: [what happened]. Verdict: [keep, revise, or discard, with reasoning].

Dream logs are stored at 0.5x weight in the memory index with a 7-day decay half-life. They surface subtly in waking searches and fade quickly. When dream content is relevant to a conversation, the agent notes the origin explicitly.
